Welcome to my new IT/tech related blog!  I've been exploring GitHub pages and Jekyll and it is looking like a pretty cool blogging platform.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
