title:  "An error occurred while starting service 'updatemgr'"
categories: vSphere

I recently upgraded an environment to vSphere 6.7 Update 1.  After updating vCenter I updated a number of hosts with vSphere Update Manager before running into this problem.  During the remediation pre-check it would just spin its wheels until it eventually timed out.  I tested this on several hosts and it was consistent across all of them.  This pre-check error was occurring on all of the remaining ESXi 6.5 hosts in vCenter. When it did eventually time out I would see this very long error message.

>Waiting for task (vim.TaskInfo) { dynamicType = null, dynamicProperty = null, key = task-116427, task = ManagedObjectReference: type = Task, value = task-116427, serverGuid = b0879725-bf73-4114-8373-59429bae84d1, description = null, name = null, descriptionId = com.vmware.vcIntegrity.RemediatePrecheckTask, entity = ManagedObjectReference: type = HostSystem, value = host-704, serverGuid = b0879725-bf73-4114-8373-59429bae84d1, entityName = esx01.local.com, locked = null, state = queued, cancelled = false, cancelable = true, error = null, result = null, progress = null, reason = (vim.TaskReasonUser) { dynamicType = null, dynamicProperty = null, userName = administrator@vsphere.local }, queueTime = java.util.GregorianCalendar[time=?, areFieldsSet=false, areAllFieldsSet=true, lenient=true, zone=sun.util.calendar.ZoneInfo[id="GMT+00:00", offset=0, dstSavings=0, useDaylight=false, transitions=0, lastRule=null], firstDayOfWeek=1, minimalDaysInFirstWeek=1, ERA=1, YEAR=2019, MONTH=7, WEEK_OF_YEAR=1, WEEK_OF_MONTH=1, DAY_OF_MONTH=12, DAY_OF_YEAR=1, DAY_OF_WEEK=5, DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH=1, AM_PM=0, HOUR=0, HOUR_OF_DAY=15, MINUTE=3, SECOND=9, MILLISECOND=791, ZONE_OFFSET=0, DST_OFFSET=0], startTime = null, completeTime = null, eventChainId = 1511731, changeTag = null, parentTaskKey = null, rootTaskKey = null, activationId = com.vmware.vcIntegrity.RemediatePrecheckTask } took more than 300 seconds! Try using timeout for longer tasks!

It seemed reasonable to try restarting the Update Manager service.  Unfortunately, after stopping the service it would not start back up.

With a little searching I found this KB article, [Resetting VMware Update Manager Database on a vCenter Server Appliance 6.5 or vCenter Server Appliance 6.7 (2147284)][1].  While this might seem like a bit of a sledgehammer approach, there wasn't much to lose by reseting the DB.  I would only need to recreate the ESXi 6.7 image and a few baselines.  There wasn't a lot of configuration stored in Update Manager in this case.  So I proceeded to follow the article and found there were a few Python modules missing that required me to run some additional commands.

On the first try, running the reset-db command indicated the ipaddr module was missing:
```shell
root@vcenter [ ~ ]# /usr/lib/vmware-updatemgr/bin/updatemgr-utility.py reset-db
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/vmware-updatemgr/bin/updatemgr-utility.py", line 11, in <module>
    from vumUtils import registerWithVc, resetDB, manageConfig
  File "/usr/lib/vmware-updatemgr/bin/vumUtils.py", line 20, in <module>
    from cis.tools import get_install_parameter

    from cis.utils import *
  File "/usr/lib/vmware/site-packages/cis/utils.py", line 45, in <module>
    import ipaddr
ImportError: No module named ipaddr
```

Using pip, the [Python package manager][2], I installed the missing module.
```shell
root@vcenter [ ~ ]# pip install ipaddr
Collecting ipaddr

```

Trying to run reset-db again produced another missing module.
```shell
root@vcenter [ ~ ]# /usr/lib/vmware-updatemgr/bin/updatemgr-utility.py reset-db
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/vmware-updatemgr/bin/updatemgr-utility.py", line 11, in <module>

  File "/usr/lib/vmware/site-packages/pyVim/sso.py", line 27, in <module>
    from lxml import etree

```

Installing lxml revealed that yet another module was needed.
```shell

This one was a bit trickier as there's no module named OpenSSL, but a quick search found that the module I was looking for was named pyopenssl.
```shell

```

pyopenssl has a few dependencies which pip also graciously installed.  Finally the database reset script completed and I was able to remove the patch store and start the update manager service.
```shell
root@vcenter [ ~ ]# /usr/lib/vmware-updatemgr/bin/updatemgr-utility.py reset-db
Resetting vSphere Update Manager database...
Successfully reset vSphere Update Manager database

root@vcenter [ ~ ]# service-control --start vmware-updatemgr
Operation not cancellable. Please wait for it to finish...
Performing start operation on service updatemgr...
Successfully started service updatemgr
```

After recreating the ESXi 6.7 image and baseline I had no further issues with upgrading and patching the remaining hosts!  To summarize, the missing modules were ipaddr, lxml, and pyopenssl.

```shell
pip install ipaddr
pip install lxml
pip install pyopenssl
```
